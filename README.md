# About

Zenburn for Emacs is a direct port of the popular
[Zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/) theme for vim,
developed by Jani Nurminen. It's my personal belief (and
that of its many users I presume) that it's one of the best low
contrast color themes out there and that it's is exceptionally easy on
the eyes. 

The theme has two versions - one for Emacs 23, relying on the
`color-theme` package and another for Emacs 24 using the built-in
theming support there.

# Installation

## Emacs 23

Zenburn depends on the `color-theme` package, so you should have it
installed. In zenburn's repo you'll find a stripped down version of
color-theme (without the built-in themes), suitable for use with
zenburn. Finally put this in your `.emacs`(or `init.el`):

``` elisp
(require 'color-theme-zenburn)
(color-theme-zenburn)
```

Zenburn for Emacs is also available for installation via the
[Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) package repository. Follow the
installation instructions there to install `package.el` and
afterwards you can install the zenburn theme like this:

`M-x package-install color-theme-zenburn`

## Emacs 24

Download `zenburn-theme.el` to the directory `~/.emacs.d/themes/`. Add this to your
`.emacs`:

`(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")`

Now you can load the theme with the interactive function `load-theme`.

## Emacs Prelude

Solarized for Emacs is already bundled into
[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-prelude). If you're a
Prelude user - you're probably already using Zenburn, since it's
Prelude's default color theme. You can load Zenburn at any time by
`M-x load-theme zenburn`.
